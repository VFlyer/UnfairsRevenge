  title: Unfair's Revenge (Normal/Cruel/Forgotten Versions)
  author: VFlyer
  description: "[i]Now it's more unfair because it took 2 months for him just to receive
    backlash. And another month just to make sure nothing else slid through badly.[/i]\r\n\r\nThis
    mod contains 3 modules: \r\n- Unfair's Revenge (as if the module was mostly in-line
    to the original mod idea)\r\n- Unfair's Cruel Revenge (as if normal decrypting
    methods were too consistent and too quick)\r\n- Unfair's Forgotten Ciphers (Ciphers
    that were originally going to be in Cruel Revenge but had complications associated
    with the setup)\nContains a sound effect from Forget Any Color, which only plays
    when you disarm Crueler Revenge.\nContains a snippet of Toby Fox - [BIG SHOT]
    (Camellia Remix), only accessible if Unfair's Forgotten Ciphers is disarmed at
    the very end.\nAlso contains 2 sound effects from Hexagon, an old flash made by
    Terry Cavanagh. The original credit to the 2 sound effects can be found from there.\n\r\nModule
